            Includes NULL-terminator.

    config LITTLEFS_USE_MTIME
        bool "Save file modification time"
        default "y"
        help
            Saves timestamp on modification. Uses an additional 4bytes.

    config LITTLEFS_USE_ONLY_HASH
        bool "Don't store filepath in the file descriptor"
        default "n"
        help
            Records the filepath only as a 32-bit hash in the file descriptor instead
            of the entire filepath. Saves approximately `sizeof(filepath)` bytes
            per file descriptor.
            If enabled, functionality (like fstat) that requires the file path
            from the file descriptor will not work.
            In rare cases, may cause unlinking or renaming issues (unlikely) if
            there's a hash collision between an open filepath and a filepath
            to be modified.

    config LITTLEFS_UNLINK_CAN_RMDIR
        bool "Allow unlink to delete empty directories"
        default "n"
        help
            Setting this to true allows the remove function to delete empty directories. https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/remove/
            This is necessary for the ghc::filesystem to be able to delete folders.

    config LITTLEFS_HUMAN_READABLE
        bool "Make errno human-readable"
        default "n"
        help
            Converts LittleFS error codes into human readable strings.
            May increase binary size depending on logging level.

        config LITTLEFS_MTIME_USE_SECONDS
            bool "Use Seconds"
            help
                Saves timestamp on modification.

        config LITTLEFS_MTIME_USE_NONCE
            bool "Use Nonce"
            help
                Saves nonce on modification; intended for detecting filechanges
                on systems without access to a RTC.

                A file who's nonce is the same as it was at a previous time has
                high probability of not having been modified.

                Upon file modification, the nonce is incremented by one. Upon file
                creation, a random nonce is assigned.

                There is a very slim chance that a file will have the same nonce if
                it is deleted and created again (approx 1 in 4 billion).

    config LITTLEFS_SPIFFS_COMPAT
        bool "Improve SPIFFS drop-in compatability"
        default "n"
        help
            Enabling this feature allows for greater drop-in compatability
            when replacing SPIFFS. Since SPIFFS doesn't have folders, and
            folders are just considered as part of a file name, enabling this
            will automatically create folders as necessary to create a file
            instead of throwing an error. Similarly, upon the deletion of the
            last file in a folder, the folder will be deleted. It is recommended
            to only enable this flag as a stop-gap solution.

    config LITTLEFS_FLUSH_FILE_EVERY_WRITE
        bool "Flush file to flash after each write operation"
        default "n"
        help
            Enabling this feature extends SPIFFS capability.
            In SPIFFS data is written immediately to the flash storage when fflush() function called.
            In LittleFS flush() does not write data to the flash, and fsync() call needed after.
            With this feature fflush() will write data to the storage.
