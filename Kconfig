    config LITTLEFS_MAX_PARTITIONS
        int "Maximum Number of Partitions"
        default 3
        range 1 10
        help
            Define maximum number of partitions that can be mounted.

    config LITTLEFS_PAGE_SIZE
        int "LITTLEFS logical page size"
        default 256
        range 256 1024
        help
            Logical page size of LITTLEFS partition, in bytes. Must be multiple
            of flash page size (which is usually 256 bytes).
            Larger page sizes reduce overhead when storing large files, and
            improve filesystem performance when reading large files.
            Smaller page sizes reduce overhead when storing small (< page size)
            files.

    config LITTLEFS_OBJ_NAME_LEN
        int "Maximum object name length including NULL terminator."
        default 64
        range 16 1022
        help
            Includes NULL-terminator. If flashing a prebuilt filesystem image,
            rebuild the filesystem image if this value changes.
            mklittlefs, the tool that generates the image will automatically be rebuilt.
            If downloading a pre-built release of mklittlefs, it was most-likely
            built with LFS_NAME_MAX=32 and should not be used.

    config LITTLEFS_READ_SIZE
        int "Minimum size of a block read."
        default 128
        help
            Minimum size of a block read. All read operations will be a
            multiple of this value.

    config LITTLEFS_WRITE_SIZE
        int "Minimum size of a block write."
        default 128
        help
            Minimum size of a block program. All write operations will be a
            multiple of this value.

    config LITTLEFS_LOOKAHEAD_SIZE
        int "Look ahead size."
        default 128
        help
            Look ahead size. Must be a multiple of 8.

    config LITTLEFS_CACHE_SIZE
        int "Cache Size"
        default 512
        help
            Size of block caches. Each cache buffers a portion of a block in RAM.
            The littlefs needs a read cache, a program cache, and one additional
            cache per file. Larger caches can improve performance by storing more
            data and reducing the number of disk accesses. Must be a multiple of
            the read and program sizes, and a factor of the block size (4096).

    config LITTLEFS_BLOCK_CYCLES
        int "LittleFS wear-leveling block cycles"
        default 512
        range -1 1024
        help
            Number of erase cycles before littlefs evicts metadata logs and moves 
            the metadata to another block. Suggested values are in the
            range 100-1000, with large values having better performance at the cost
            of less consistent wear distribution.
            Set to -1 to disable block-level wear-leveling.

    config LITTLEFS_USE_MTIME
        bool "Save file modification time"
        default "y"
        help
            Saves timestamp on modification. Uses an additional 4bytes.
    
    config LITTLEFS_USE_ONLY_HASH
        bool "Don't store filepath in the file descriptor"
        default "n"
        help
            Records the filepath only as a 32-bit hash in the file descriptor instead
            of the entire filepath. Saves approximately `sizeof(filepath)` bytes
            per file descriptor.
            If enabled, functionality (like fstat) that requires the file path 
            from the file descriptor will not work.
            In rare cases, may cause unlinking or renaming issues (unlikely) if
            there's a hash collision between an open filepath and a filepath
            to be modified.

    config LITTLEFS_HUMAN_READABLE
        bool "Make errno human-readable"
        default "n"
        help
            Converts LittleFS error codes into human readable strings.
            May increase binary size depending on logging level.

    choice LITTLEFS_MTIME
        prompt "mtime attribute options"
        depends on LITTLEFS_USE_MTIME
        default LITTLEFS_MTIME_USE_SECONDS
        help
            Save an additional 4-byte attribute. Options listed below.

        config LITTLEFS_MTIME_USE_SECONDS
            bool "Use Seconds"
            help
                Saves timestamp on modification.

        config LITTLEFS_MTIME_USE_NONCE
            bool "Use Nonce"
            help
                Saves nonce on modification; intended for detecting filechanges
                on systems without access to a RTC.

                A file who's nonce is the same as it was at a previous time has 
                high probability of not having been modified.

                Upon file modification, the nonce is incremented by one. Upon file
                creation, a random nonce is assigned.

                There is a very slim chance that a file will have the same nonce if
                it is deleted and created again (approx 1 in 4 billion).

    config LITTLEFS_SPIFFS_COMPAT
        bool "Improve SPIFFS drop-in compatability"
        default "n"
        help
            Enabling this feature allows for greater drop-in compatability
            when replacing SPIFFS. Since SPIFFS doesn't have folders, and 
            folders are just considered as part of a file name, enabling this
            will automatically create folders as necessary to create a file
            instead of throwing an error. Similarly, upon the deletion of the
            last file in a folder, the folder will be deleted. It is recommended
            to only enable this flag as a stop-gap solution.
            
    config LITTLEFS_FLUSH_FILE_EVERY_WRITE
        bool "Flush file to flash after each write operation"
        default "n"
        help
            Enabling this feature extends SPIFFS capability.
            In SPIFFS data is written immediately to the flash storage when fflush() function called.
            In LittleFS flush() does not write data to the flash, and fsync() call needed after.
            With this feature fflush() will write data to the storage.

    config LITTLEFS_OPEN_DIR
        bool "Support opening directory"
        default "n"

            Support getting directory by following APIs:

    config LITTLEFS_FCNTL_F_GETPATH_VALUE
        int "Value of command F_GETPATH"
        default 20
        depends on LITTLEFS_FCNTL_GET_PATH
        help
            ESP-IDF's header file "fcntl.h" doesn't support macro "F_GETPATH",
            so we should define this macro here.
